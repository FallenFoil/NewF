## NewF

**NewF** is a program that creates programming files from different programming languages (C, C++, Java, ShellScript, flex and gawk) and opens them. 

By default, it uses Visual studio Code to open the newly created file, but you can modify using 2 methods:
- Changing the string *"code"* to the command to your text editor in the 6ยบ line of the main function in the source code;
- Or give the command to your text editor as an argument of the **NewF** executable, like `./NewF nano`.

## How to Use
* **Compiling:** "make"
* **Executing:** "./NewF"
